						Graph Theory and Application: Course Project 2020
						-------------------------------------------------
Objective: Diving deeper into one of the problems from the list provided in ProjectIdeas section 
and becoming "expert" in the narrow problem you choose.	Note only one or two representative papers are 
provided with these project ideas. These papers are the bare minimum one should read. However, do 
not restrict to these papers alone, read and understand atleast 2-3 more papers with similar themes. 


------------
Project Ideas:
-------------
1. Min cut with application to image segmentation - [1] [2]
2. Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques - [3]
3. GCN - [9] (prerequisite: Knowledge of deep learning)
4. Graph Edit Distance - [8]
5. Node2vec - [9]
6. Isomorphism - [4]                                   
7. Ranking Algorithms (e.g Google’s Page Rank) - [5]
8. Graph Matching in Computer Vision (prerequisite: Knowledge of computer vision) [6]                                                 
9. Basics of undirected graphical models - [7]
10. (Pedagogical project for developers) Develop an online web demo for five graph theory concepts.
11. Other similar topic (take permission of instructor)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Expectation:
----------
Oct 4, 2020: Form a group of three and let us know team members and project ideas.
Oct 12,2020: Have an understanding of the problem, and brief 1-page report
Nov 1, 2020: 20-minute quality presentation slides (maybe recorded video), a six-page technical
report including some basic implementation and detailed explanation of the problem with examples. 
For theory projects, implementation is not a must, and for demo (Project idea 11) creativity and quality ofdemo alone will matter.

-------
Intermediate submission   : 5 Points
Report                    : 25 Points
Presentation slides+vivia : 60 Points
Extra effort              : 10 Points (Claim, Pass and Get)
------------------------------------------------
Total: 100 Points

Important Dates:
----------------
Oct 1, 2020: Project release
Oct 4, 2020: Project selection, group formation
Oct 12,2020: Intermediate submission (1 page)
